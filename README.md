# MolCube AFES RBFE

We conducted a benchmark study using MolCube’s Alchemical Free Energy Simulation (AFES) workflow. Relative binding free energies were calculated with three methods: Amber-TI, GROMACS-NETI, and BLaDE-MSLD.

In addition to the JACS benchmark set used by Wang et al., we performed two case studies (3BQD and 5EDU) and obtained reliable results.

The AFES input files generated by MolCube Apps are available in this Git repository.
